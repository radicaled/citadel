# LORD FOOL'S GREAT PLAN

So I've been iterating on this in a "build-as-you-go" way which has been fine.

But I feel like now is the time to solidify the engine, scripting, etc.

Then once all that is core we can move to doing straight game logic without worrying about building out engine features
along-side the game logic.

- Improved Engine Support:
    - Building of objects
    - Scripting of objects
    - Animating of objects
    - Inventory System
    - Specifying the contents of an entity.

- Improved Client Support:
    - Re-useable user interface
    - Proper "login" screen:
        - Pick / customize character.
        - Pick job (do nothing for now)
