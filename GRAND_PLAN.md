# LORD FOOL'S GREAT PLAN

So I've been iterating on this in a "build-as-you-go" way which has been fine.

But I feel like now is the time to solidify the engine, scripting, etc.

Then once all that is core we can move to doing straight game logic without worrying about building out engine features
along-side the game logic.

- Improved Engine Support:
    - Player-tracking camera
    - Building of objects
    - Scripting of objects
    - Animating of objects
